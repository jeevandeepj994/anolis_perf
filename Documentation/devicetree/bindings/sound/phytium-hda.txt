* Phytium HDA controller

The HDA bus (High Definition Audio sound bus) is a serial link for digital
audio data transfer between devices in the system.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "phytium,hda"
- reg: physical base address and length of HDA controller.
- interrupts: interrupt for the hda controller.
- clocks: phandle to clock provider with the clock number in the second cell.
- clock-name: the name of the device clock.

Example for D2000 HDA controller:

hda: hda@28206000 {
	compatible = "phytium,hda";
	reg = <0 0x28206000 0x0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 23 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&sysclk_48mhz>;
	clock-names = "phytium_hda_clk";
};
