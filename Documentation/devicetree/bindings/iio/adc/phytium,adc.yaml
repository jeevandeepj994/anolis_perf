title: Phytium Analog To Digital Converters Device Tree Bindings

description: |
  This device is a 10-bit converter for 8 voltage channels.
  All inputs are single ended.

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - description: Should be "phytium,adc"

  reg:
    items:
      - description: memory window mapping address and length

  interrupts:
    items:
      - description: Interrupt for the ADC control interface.

  clocks:
    items:
      - description: Input clock used to derive the sample clock.

  #address-cells:
    items:
      - description: Should be <1> (settings for the subnodes).

  #size-cells:
    items:
      - description: Should be <0> (settings for the subnodes).

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
  - interrupts
  - clock
  - #address-cells
  - #size-cells

Required subnodes:
  - The ADC channels are configured as subnodes of the ADC.

Required channel node properties:
  - reg: should contain the hardware channel number.
